# PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER:

A password complexity checker is a tool or algorithm used to assess the strength and security of a password based on various criteria. The main goal of such a checker is to ensure that passwords are difficult to guess or crack by attackers, thus enhancing the overall security of systems and user accounts.

# IMPROVING THE PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER:

To make the password checker even more robust, consider adding checks for:

1. Common Passwords: Cross-reference against a list of commonly used passwords.
2. Character Variety: Ensure that the password does not repeat characters excessively.
3. Sequence and Patterns: Detect and discourage sequences like "abcd" or "1234".

~ A good password complexity checker is an essential tool for maintaining security in any system that relies on user authentication. It encourages users to create stronger passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

# EXAMPLE USAGE:

Python continues to read and execute each line of code sequentially.

1. Assigning password: The variable password is assigned the string value "P@ssw0rd".

2. Calling assess_password_strength(): The function assess_password_strength(password) is called with the argument "P@ssw0rd".

3. Processing within assess_password_strength():

   3.1. Inside assess_password_strength(password), the function evaluates various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters in the password.
   
   3.2. It calculates a score based on these criteria and determines the strength of the password ("Very Strong", "Strong", "Moderate", or "Weak").
   
   3.3. It also generates feedback messages indicating areas where the password can be improved.
Printing Results: Finally, the results are printed to the console:

"Password Strength: Very Strong"
"Score: 7"
Feedback messages (if any)...
